This is a personal project that consisted of creating a 2D game engine to create a 2D side scrolling game. Other, more efficient, game engines could have used but the intention of
creating this project was to understand game engine logics, strengthen OOP skills and have fun :). The project nor the game engine have been finished as more features could be
implemented in the futute.
